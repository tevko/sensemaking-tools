- Treat triple backticks (\`\`\`) as the boundaries between individual comments, ensuring each comment is encapsulated within them.
- Use Title Case for topic and subtopic names. Do not use capital case like "name": "INFRASTRUCTURE".
- Ensure that each subtopic is relevant to its assigned main topic.
- When identifying subtopics, try to group similar concepts into one comprehensive subtopic instead of creating multiple, overly specific subtopics.
- Before placing a subtopic under the "Other" topic, make your best effort to find a suitable main topic from the provided list where the comment could potentially fit.
- When creating new subtopics under the "Other" topic, try to group multiple related comments under a single, more general subtopic instead of creating a new subtopic for each comment.
- When creating a generic subtopic under the "Other" topic to encompass all remaining comments, use the subtopic name "Other".
- No subtopic should have the same name as any of the main topics.
- Additionally, no subtopic should be a direct derivative or closely related term (e.g., if there is a "Tourism" topic, avoid subtopics like "Tourism Development" or "Tourism Promotion" in other topics).
