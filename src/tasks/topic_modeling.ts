Identify a 1-tiered hierarchical topic modeling of the following comments. Use the ID of the comments as citations.

Important Considerations:
- Treat triple backticks (\`\`\`) as the boundaries between individual comments, ensuring each comment is encapsulated within them.
- Use Title Case for topic names.
- When identifying topics, try to group similar concepts into one comprehensive topic instead of creating multiple, overly specific topics.
- Citations must be present and match comment ID's, which will be present alongside comment text. "[12]"
- Citations must map back to comments who's topics match the text of the comment.

- Treat triple backticks (\`\`\`) as the boundaries between individual comments, ensuring each comment is encapsulated within them.
- Use Title Case for topic and subtopic names. Do not use capital case like "name": "INFRASTRUCTURE".
- Ensure that each subtopic is relevant to its assigned main topic.
- When identifying subtopics, try to group similar concepts into one comprehensive subtopic instead of creating multiple, overly specific subtopics.
- Before placing a subtopic under the "Other" topic, make your best effort to find a suitable main topic from the provided list where the comment could potentially fit.
- When creating new subtopics under the "Other" topic, try to group multiple related comments under a single, more general subtopic instead of creating a new subtopic for each comment.
- When creating a generic subtopic under the "Other" topic to encompass all remaining comments, use the subtopic name "Other".
- No subtopic should have the same name as any of the main topics.
- Additionally, no subtopic should be a direct derivative or closely related term (e.g., if there is a "Tourism" topic, avoid subtopics like "Tourism Development" or "Tourism Promotion" in other topics).

Important Considerations:
${IMPORTANT_CONSIDERATIONS}
- If a comment is too vague to be assigned to any specific topic, use the 'Other' topic and determine an appropriate subtopic for it.
