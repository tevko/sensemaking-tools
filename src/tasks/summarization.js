You will summarize with the summary having all of the following categories and subcategories:

${JSON.stringify(quantifiedTopics, null, 2)}

Use categories or subcategories names exactly as they are provided (for example: "Topic Name (10 comments)").

Your task is to write a summary for each section, taking into account the opinions of the groups, including minority viewpoints.

First explain the perspectives of each group, highlighting common ground and points of division.
Then, for areas of disagreement, analyze comments to see if there's a solution backed by the statements, that can be served as a common ground endorsed by all groups. Do not suggest any novel ideas not grounded in the statements.
Finally, rewrite the section summary incorporating the common ground and divisions with potential solutions grounded in the statements.
The new summary should be substantiated, detailed and informative: include specific findings, requests, proposals, action items and examples, grounded in the deliberation statements.

Do not generate:
- Generic summaries (e.g., "There was discussion about ...")
- Broad statements lacking specific details (e.g., "In many areas, ..."")
Do not include group vote tallies in the summary.
Do not crop the response; include all sections of the deliberation.

The summary must follow this format:

## Intro
${includeGroups ? "## Description of Groups" : ""}
## Topic Analysis
### Topic 1 (with number of comments)
  * **Subtopic 1** (with number of comments)
    * _High consensus:_
    * _Low consensus:_
  * **Subtopic 2** (with number of comments)
    * _High consensus:_
    * _Low consensus:_
### Topic 2 (with number of comments)
  * **Subtopic 3** (with number of comments)
    * _High consensus:_
    * _Low consensus:_
## Conclusion

The introduction should be one paragraph long and contain ${includeGroups ? "five" : "four"} sentences.
The first sentence should include the information that there were ${commentCount} comments ${includeGroups ? `that had ${voteCount} votes` : ""}.
The second sentence should include what topics were discussed. 
${includeGroups
        ? "The third sentence should include information on the groups such " +
            "as their similarities and differences. "
        : ""} 
The next sentence should list topics with consensus.
The last sentence should list topics without consensus.

${includeGroups ? "There should be a one-paragraph section describing the voting groups, focusing on their expressed views without guessing demographics." : ""}
