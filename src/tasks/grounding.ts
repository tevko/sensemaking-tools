In what follows you will be a given a summary of the outputs from a deliberative excercise. You will eventually be going through a list of comments and associated metadata (which might include voting patterns) and tasked with identifying source comments (and associated metadata) that substantiates the claims being made in the summary. This task is called "grounding". But that will come later.

For now, you job is the following: Identify portions of text in the summary making claims that need to be so grounded, and mark them by bracketing with double square brackets [[]], followed by a ^ character, and an empty set of single square brackets, which will eventually (in a later step) be the place where you identify grounding comment-ids, like this:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded]]^[]

If a portion of text is followed by a punctuation mark, like a comma, period, etc., then include the punctuation within the double brackets, like this:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded,]]^[]
    [[a claim that needs to be grounded.]]^[]

However, prefer marking segments of texts that identify atomic or singular claims, rather than larger chunks (like complete sentences) of text making a larger number of claims.

THIS IS IMPORTANT! Leave any portion of text from the original summary that does not need to be grounded alone. The overall structure of the summary text should not change, and all text, punctuation, indentation and aspects of markdown notation should be left as is. The only changes to the original text you should make are in the addition of brackets as described above.

Here is the summary for grounding:

${summary}`;
}

/**
 * Prompt for the second step of grounding, which is to identify the comments that ground the claims in the summary.
 * @param summary
 * @param comments
 */
export function assignGroundingPrompt(summary: string, comments: Comment[]): string {
  return `
In what follows you will be a given a summary of the outputs from a deliberative excercise, together with the comments and associated metadata that were the inputs for those summaries. This metadata specifically includes a comment-id, and possibly also a summary of voting patterns for some number of opinion or demographic groups. Portions of the summary that have been surrounded by double square brackets [[]], have been previously identified as claims that need to be grounded in (i.e. backed up by) comments submitted as part of the deliberation.

Your job: for each portion of text in the summary that is making a statement about the content of what was said in the comments (or how participants expressed themselves via votes submitted in response to other participant's comments), identify those comments that substantiate the claims being made in the corresponding portion of text, and place the comment ids for those statements in the single square brackets following the ^ character. For example, if you see a summary statement that looks like:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded]]^[]

And you identify that comments 3, 5, and 10 support the summary statement, you would output the following in its place:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded]]^[3,5,10]

You may notice that some statements marked for grounding already have comment ids assigned to them. If so, and you
identify new comments that help groun the statement, you can add those comment ids to the existing set.

THIS IS IMPORTANT!
Leave any portion of text from the original summary that does not need to be grounded alone.

In what follows you will be a given a summary of the outputs from a deliberative excercise, together with the comments and associated metadata that were the inputs for those summaries. This metadata specifically includes a comment-id, and possibly also a summary of voting patterns for some number of opinion or demographic groups. Portions of the summary that have been surrounded by double square brackets [[]], have been previously identified as claims that need to be grounded in (i.e. backed up by) comments submitted as part of the deliberation. These portions of text will be followed by a ^ and then another set of single square brackets [] containing a list of comment ids which may or may not ground the summary statement. For example, you might see:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded]]^[3,5,10]

for a statement that has comments that have been identified as possibly grounding it. Or you may see:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded]]^[]

if no statements have been identified as grounding the statement.

Your job: for each portion of text in the summary that has been so marked, check that the comments corresponding to the flagged comment ids actually back up the corresponding claim. If a marked comment id does not back up a claim in the summary, remove it from the list of comment ids.

If vote tallies (by grouping factor) are included in the comment data, pay attention to not just the content of the comments in relation to the summary claims, but also to whether the claims accurately reflect the vote breakdown. As you do this, pay attention not just to the marked portion of text, but also the context in which it is situated, such as surrounding text, or event the section it falls in (which might contextualize the claim being made about the highlighted portion of text).

In what follows you will be given a summay of the outputs from a deliberative excercise. Portions of the summary that have been surrounded by double square brackets [[]] have been previously identified as being in need of grounding (that is, of being backed up by comments submitted as part of the deliberation). Portions of text so marked will be followed by a ^ and then another set of single square brackets [] containing a list of comment ids which have been identified as grounding the statement. For example, you might see:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded.]]^[3,5,10]

for a statement that has comments that have been identified as possibly grounding it. Or you may see:

    [[a claim that needs to be grounded.]]^[]

if no comments have been identified as grounding the statement.

Your job: for each statement in the summary that has been so marked, if there are no comments that have been found to ground the statement, then remove the statement from the summary, and if necessary, adjust the surrounding text to that it makes sense without the removed statement.

THIS IS IMPORTANT!
Leave in any portion of text from the original summary that does not need to be grounded and is not invalidated by the removal of a claim. The overall structure of the summary text should not change, and all text, punctuation, indentation and aspects of markdown notation should be left as is, unless they have become unecessary due to the removal of text as described above.
